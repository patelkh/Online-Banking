This Java program is an online banking application designed to simulate basic banking operations, enabling users to manage checking accounts, perform financial transactions, and generate various reports. The application's graphical user interface (GUI) provides an intuitive platform for users to interact with the system.

Upon launching the application, users are presented with a menu containing options to open and save account data from/to file, add new accounts, list transactions, list checks, list deposits, list service charges, find accounts, and list all accounts. These options allow users to perform a range of activities related to account management and financial tracking.

Users can create new checking accounts by specifying the account holder's name and initial balance. The application allows users to process transactions, such as writing checks and making deposits. For check transactions, users input the check amount and check number, which then updates the account balance accordingly. Deposits involve entering cash and check amounts, with the total deposit amount being credited to the account.

The application also offers comprehensive reporting functionalities. Users can generate reports that list all transactions, checks, deposits, and service charges associated with a specific account. Additionally, users can list details of all accounts, providing an overview of balances and service charges.

The program is designed to handle service charges for specific scenarios, such as charging fees for writing checks, making deposits, or maintaining a balance below a certain threshold. The system automatically calculates and applies appropriate service charges based on transaction types and account balances.

The GUI interface ensures user-friendly interaction by displaying prompts, input fields, and messages within a graphical window. This makes it accessible for users who may not be familiar with command-line interfaces. The application streamlines banking operations, assists in tracking account activities, and facilitates informed financial decision-making.
